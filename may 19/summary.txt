The sweet orange (Citrus Ã— sinensis), a hybrid of pomelo and mandarin orange, originated in Southern China, Northeast India, and Myanmar.  Its cultivation spread via the Arab Agricultural Revolution to the Iberian Peninsula and then, via Italian and Portuguese merchants, throughout Europe, where it became a luxury item.  Spanish explorers introduced it to the Americas.  Today, Brazil is the leading producer of oranges globally. The fruit's history is intertwined with human culture, featuring prominently in art and architecture (e.g., the Versailles Orangerie).  The Wikipedia article details the orange's botanical characteristics, cultivation methods, pests and diseases, culinary uses, and its diverse cultivars (e.g., Valencia, Navel, Blood oranges).
